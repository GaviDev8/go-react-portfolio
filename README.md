# Gabriela Ortiz (GO) Portfolio

## Description
Welcome! This is a collection of the projects I'm currently developing as I build my professional portfolio.

👾 Motivation: Being a developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

👾 Project Purpose: These projects serve to enrich my resume and enhance my career prospects.

👾 Lessons Learned: Through these endeavors, I'm gaining a solid grasp of fundamental coding languages.
